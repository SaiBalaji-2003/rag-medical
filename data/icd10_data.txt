F00-F09 Organic, including symptomatic, mental disorders

F00 - Dementia in Alzheimer's disease: This diagnosis is used for dementia that is directly caused by Alzheimer's disease. The dementia is characterized by a slow, progressive decline in memory, thinking, and reasoning skills.

F01 - Vascular dementia: This type of dementia is the result of brain damage due to cerebrovascular disease, such as strokes. The onset is often sudden, and the course is typically stepwise, with periods of stability followed by abrupt declines in function.

F02 - Dementia in other diseases classified elsewhere: This code is for dementia that is a manifestation of other medical conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, or HIV.

F03 - Unspecified dementia: This code is used when a diagnosis of dementia is made, but the underlying cause is not specified or is unknown.

F04 - Organic amnesic syndrome, not induced by alcohol and other psychoactive substances: This syndrome is characterized by a significant impairment in memory (both recent and remote) due to known brain damage or disease, but not caused by substance use. Other cognitive functions are relatively intact.
